			<p class="mb-1">It was 1886 when the world's first automobile officially came to light. It weighed 360 kg
                and had two gears, a wooden brake on the rear wheel, and a single-cylinder engine powered by
                ligroin producing 0.8 hp. It was the Patent-Motorwagen, and shortly thereafter its inventor, Carl Benz, and his future
                partner, Gottlieb Daimler, would change the course of history forever, not just in transportation.
                The recognition of this achievement was officially confirmed in 2011, with the inclusion of the patent in
                UNESCO's World Documentary Heritage.

            <p class="mb-1">Mercedes was present in Grand Prix competitions since the early 1900s: notable victories include the prestigious wins in the French Grand Prix of 1908 and 1914, but especially the numerous triumphs during the period of 1934-1939, when the German marque won 34 Grand Prix out of 56 contested and clinched the European Championship in automotive racing (1935-1937-1938), which was the most prestigious automotive championship in the world, precursor to the subsequent Formula 1 World Championship established in 1950, in which Mercedes participated victoriously in the 1954-55 biennium securing two Drivers' World Championships before withdrawing. It returned to Formula 1 first as a supplier and then as a constructor.</p>
